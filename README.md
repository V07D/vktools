# vktools
Some useful tools for vk.com

#Installation
Just drag-n-drop **vktools.user.js** into opened **about:extensions** page in Chrome (Chromium).

#Known issues
This is an alpha-version and there are some troubles and limitations in it. First, you have to use Scroll link to (suddenly!) scroll main VK profile page to bottom, because that's how VK works: new posts load while you scroll window to bottom. There are some ways to bypass it, but none of those are implemented yet. Stay tuned.
